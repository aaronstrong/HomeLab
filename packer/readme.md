# About
This directory is for automated build images, using Hashicorp Packer.

# What is Packer?
[Packer](https://packer.io/intro/index.html) is an open source tool developed by Hashicorp to create machine images.  Packer is a lightweight application that runs on just about every operating system. The process to create an image for one platform, can be repeated to make an image for a different platform.

Machine Images are single static artifacts that contain a pre-configured operating system which is used to create new running machines. Machine image formats change for each platform. This repository will be used to create machine images for VMware.
